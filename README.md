# Project Overview
The CPP Modules project involves completing a series of modules, each exploring different aspects 
of object-oriented programming in C++. The modules cover topics such as class creation, member 
functions, operator overloading, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.

# Modules 
The project is divided into several modules, each addressing specific topics in 
C++ programming. Each module builds upon the previous one, allowing for a progressive learning experience.

00 - specifities of C++ when compared to C -> First try at object oriented programming
01 - memory allocation, reference, pointers to members and the usage of the switch statement
02 - ad-hoc polymorphism, overloads and orthodox canonical classes
03 - inheritance
04 - subtype polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces
05 - try/catch and exceptions
06 - casting
07 - templates
08 - templated containers, iterators and algorithms
09 - containers deep dive
