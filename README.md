# Project Overview
The CPP Modules project involves completing a series of modules, each exploring different aspects 
of object-oriented programming in C++. The modules cover topics such as class creation, member 
functions, operator overloading, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.

# Modular Structure: 
The project is divided into several modules, each addressing specific topics in 
C++ programming. Each module builds upon the previous one, allowing for a progressive learning experience.

The modules are typically organized as follows:

Module X: Covers a particular topic or concept (e.g., classes, operator overloading, inheritance, etc.).
Exercises: Contains the exercises and challenges which were completed as part of the module.
Tests: Includes test cases to verify the correctness of the implementations.
